# Phase 15: Client Management - COMPLETE ✅

**Date**: January 28, 2026  
**Status**: ✅ **100% COMPLETE**

---

## Implementation Summary

### ✅ What Was Implemented

**1. Client Types** (`src/lib/types/client.types.ts`)

- `ClientStatus` enum (active, suspended, inactive)
- `Client` interface with all required fields and statistics
- `ClientCreateInput`, `ClientUpdateInput`, and `ClientFilterInput` interfaces

**2. Client Service** (`src/lib/services/client.service.ts`)

- `create()` - Create new client with password hashing
- `getById()` - Get client by ID with statistics
- `list()` - List clients with filters and pagination
- `update()` - Update client information
- `delete()` - Delete client (soft delete)
- `getClientStatistics()` - Get client booking statistics (total bookings, total spent, last booking date)

**3. Client Policy** (`src/lib/policies/client.policy.ts`)

- `canView()` - Authorization for viewing clients
- `canCreate()` - Authorization for creating clients
- `canUpdate()` - Authorization for updating clients
- `canDelete()` - Authorization for deleting clients

**4. Client Validators** (`src/lib/validators/client.validator.ts`)

- `createClientSchema` - Validation for creating clients
- `updateClientSchema` - Validation for updating clients
- `clientFilterSchema` - Validation for client filters

**5. Password Hashing** (`src/lib/auth/auth-helpers.ts`)

- Added `hashPassword()` function using bcryptjs
- Added `verifyPassword()` function for password verification

**6. API Routes**

- `GET /api/clients` - List clients with filters
- `POST /api/clients` - Create new client
- `GET /api/clients/[id]` - Get client by ID
- `PATCH /api/clients/[id]` - Update client
- `DELETE /api/clients/[id]` - Delete client

**7. Admin Pages**

- `GET /admin/clients` - Clients list page with filters, search, statistics, and actions

**8. Integration**

- Added client events to EventBus (`client.created`, `client.updated`, `client.deleted`)
- Sidebar already includes clients link (`/admin/clients`)
- Client statistics integration (bookings, spending, last booking date)

## Features

### Client Management

- Create new clients with email, name, phone, password
- View all clients with filters (status, role, search, date range, has bookings)
- Update client information (name, phone, status, role)
- Delete clients (soft delete)
- Search clients by name, email, or phone

### Client Statistics

- Total bookings count
- Total spending amount
- Last booking date
- Statistics calculated on-the-fly from booking data

### Client Status

- **Active**: Client can use the system
- **Suspended**: Client temporarily suspended
- **Inactive**: Client inactive

### Security

- Password hashing with bcryptjs (10 salt rounds)
- All operations require proper permissions
- Policy-based authorization
- Audit logging for all client operations
- Soft delete (no hard deletes)

---

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Password Hashing

- Uses bcryptjs library (already in dependencies)
- 10 salt rounds for security
- Password hashing function added to `auth-helpers.ts`
- Password verification function also added

### Client Statistics

- Calculated on-the-fly from booking data
- Includes: total bookings, total spent, last booking date
- Statistics included in client list and detail views

### Client Role

- Default role: `DATA_ENTRY` (used as client role)
- Can assign other roles if needed
- Role-based access control

### Search Functionality

- Search by email (case-insensitive)
- Search by name (case-insensitive)
- Search by phone (case-insensitive)
- Combined search across all fields

---

## Code Quality

- ✅ **TypeScript Errors**: 0 (client-related)
- ✅ **Type Safety**: All types properly defined
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Proper try/catch blocks
- ✅ **Validation**: Zod schemas for all inputs
- ✅ **Authorization**: Policy-based access control
- ✅ **Audit Logging**: All operations logged
- ✅ **Event Emission**: All critical actions emit events

---

## Test Results

### ✅ Static Analysis: **PASSED**

- **Files**: 4 core files (types, service, policy, validator)
- **API Routes**: 2 routes
- **Admin Pages**: 1 page
- **TypeScript Errors**: 0 (client-related)

### ✅ File Structure: **COMPLETE**

- ✅ Client types defined
- ✅ Client service implemented
- ✅ Client policy implemented
- ✅ Client validators implemented
- ✅ API routes created
- ✅ Admin pages created
- ✅ Password hashing utilities added

---

## Known Limitations

### ⚠️ Current Implementation Notes:

1. **Client Role**: Uses `DATA_ENTRY` as default client role
   - **Future**: Consider adding explicit `CLIENT` role to UserRole enum

2. **Password Reset**: Not yet implemented
   - **Future**: Add password reset functionality
   - **Future**: Email-based password reset

3. **Client Profile**: No detailed client profile page yet
   - **Future**: Create detailed client view page (`/admin/clients/[id]`)
   - **Future**: Show booking history, payment history, etc.

4. **Bulk Operations**: Not yet implemented
   - **Future**: Bulk client import
   - **Future**: Bulk status updates

---

## Next Steps for Runtime Testing

1. **Start Dev Server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Create Test Data**:
   - Create test clients
   - Create test bookings for clients
   - Test client statistics

3. **Test Flow**:
   - Navigate to `/admin/clients`
   - Create new client
   - View client list with filters
   - Search for clients
   - View client statistics
   - Update client information
   - Test client deletion
