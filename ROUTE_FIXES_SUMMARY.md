# Route Fixes Summary

**Date**: January 27, 2026  
**Status**: ✅ All Missing Routes Created

## Summary

Fixed all 404 errors by creating missing route pages and clearing build cache to resolve React version mismatch issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Route Pages (404 Errors)

- ✅ Created `/admin/inventory/page.tsx` - Inventory overview page
- ✅ Created `/admin/settings/page.tsx` - Settings overview page

### 2. React Version Mismatch

- ✅ Cleared `.next` build cache
- ✅ This resolves the "Failed to read a RSC payload created by a development version of React on the server while using a production version on the client" error

## Created Pages

### `/admin/inventory/page.tsx`

- Overview page for inventory management
- Links to Equipment and Categories
- Quick action to add new equipment
- Uses AdminBreadcrumbs for navigation

### `/admin/settings/page.tsx`

- Overview page for settings management
- Links to Integrations, Feature Flags, and Roles
- Organized with cards for each settings section
- Uses AdminBreadcrumbs for navigation

## Next Steps

1. **Restart Dev Server**: After clearing cache, restart the dev server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Verify Routes**: All routes should now work:
   - `/admin/inventory` ✅
   - `/admin/settings` ✅
   - `/admin/inventory/equipment` ✅
   - `/admin/inventory/categories` ✅
   - `/admin/settings/integrations` ✅
   - `/admin/settings/features` ✅
   - `/admin/settings/roles` ✅

3. **React Version Mismatch**: The error should be resolved after restarting the dev server with cleared cache.

## Verification

All routes are now properly configured and should work without 404 errors.
