# API Contract Validator

## When to Trigger

- Changes to API route files (src/app/api/\*\*/route.ts)
- Changes to Zod schemas
- Changes to response types
- User mentions "API", "endpoint", "route"

## What to Do

### Step 1: Extract Current Contract

Document:

- Endpoint and method
- Auth requirement
- Request params (types, optional/required)
- Response shape (data, meta, etc.)
- Status codes (200, 401, 500, etc.)

### Step 2: Compare with Proposed Changes

Show diff of params and response. Mark: unchanged ✅, new ⚠️, removed ❌.

### Step 3: Report

Output:

```markdown
## API Contract Changes

### Endpoint: [METHOD] [path]

#### Request Parameters

[BEFORE/AFTER or unchanged/new/removed]

#### Response Body

BEFORE: [shape]
AFTER: [shape]
Breaking: Yes/No | Backwards compatible: Yes/No

#### Affected Clients:

- [Client name]: Compatible / Update needed

#### Migration for Clients:

```

If breaking (e.g. changing `{ data: [] }` to raw array), recommend: new v2 endpoint, or optional query param (e.g. `?format=array`) while keeping default. Do not proceed with breaking change without explicit migration strategy.
