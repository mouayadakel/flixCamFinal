# Error Fixes Summary

**Date**: January 27, 2026  
**Status**: ✅ All Errors Fixed

## Summary

All console logs, warnings, and build errors have been resolved. The application now builds successfully with no errors.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Console Logs Removed

- ✅ Removed `console.log` from `admin-sidebar.tsx`
- ✅ Removed `console.log` from `notification.service.ts` (email/WhatsApp placeholders)
- ✅ Removed `console.warn` from `integration-config.service.ts`
- ✅ Removed `console.log` from `webhooks/tap/route.ts`

### 2. Console Errors Wrapped in Development Checks

All `console.error` statements are now wrapped in development environment checks:

- ✅ `app/admin/error.tsx` - Only logs in development
- ✅ `app/api/user/permissions/route.ts` - Only logs in development
- ✅ `app/api/admin/jobs/rerun/route.ts` - Only logs in development
- ✅ `app/api/webhooks/tap/route.ts` - Only logs in development
- ✅ `components/admin/audit-trail-viewer.tsx` - Only logs in development

### 3. API Route Dynamic Configuration

Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to all API routes that were causing build errors:

- ✅ `app/api/user/permissions/route.ts`
- ✅ `app/api/admin/health/route.ts`
- ✅ `app/api/integrations/route.ts`
- ✅ `app/api/approvals/pending/route.ts`
- ✅ `app/api/admin/read-only/route.ts`
- ✅ `app/api/feature-flags/route.ts`

### 4. API Route Request Parameter Fixes

Fixed API routes that were using `new Request('')` instead of the actual request parameter:

- ✅ Updated all routes to accept `request: Request` parameter
- ✅ Updated `rateLimitAPI` calls to use the actual request object

### 5. Error Handling Improvements

- ✅ Consistent error handling across all components
- ✅ Proper fallback behavior when API calls fail
- ✅ No console output in production builds

## Build Status

✅ **TypeScript**: No type errors  
✅ **Build**: Successful with no errors  
✅ **Linter**: No linting errors  
✅ **Console**: No unnecessary console statements in production

## Remaining Console Statements

The following `console.error` statements remain but are wrapped in development checks:

- Error boundaries (for debugging during development)
- API error handlers (for server-side debugging during development)

These are appropriate and will not appear in production builds.

## Verification

Run the following commands to verify:

```bash
npm run type-check  # Should pass with no errors
npm run build       # Should build successfully
```

All checks pass! ✅
