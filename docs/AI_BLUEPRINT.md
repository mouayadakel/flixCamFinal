# AI Blueprint (Phase 2)

## AI Philosophy

**AI recommends, never executes**

All AI decisions must be explainable and logged. AI is a decision support system, not an autonomous agent.

## AI Rules

1. **AI recommends, never executes**: All AI suggestions require human approval
2. **Explainable decisions**: All AI decisions must be explainable
3. **Logged actions**: All AI actions are logged for audit
4. **Human override**: Humans can always override AI decisions

## AI Responsibilities

### 1. Risk Scoring

- Analyze booking risk factors
- Generate risk score (0-100)
- Recommend approval workflow
- Explain risk factors

### 2. Deposit Suggestion

- Calculate recommended deposit based on:
  - Equipment value
  - Customer history
  - Rental duration
  - Risk score
- Provide reasoning

### 3. Equipment Alternatives

- Suggest alternative equipment when unavailable
- Consider compatibility
- Match specifications
- Explain recommendations

### 4. Smart Bundles

- Recommend equipment bundles
- Studio + Equipment combinations
- Based on project type
- Optimize pricing

### 5. Assistant Requirement

- Determine if assistant is needed
- Based on equipment complexity
- Customer experience level
- Project requirements

### 6. Demand Prediction

- Predict equipment demand
- Optimize inventory levels
- Suggest purchase decisions
- Forecast revenue

## AI Integration (Phase 2)

### LLM Provider

- **Primary**: OpenAI (GPT-4)
- **Alternative**: Google Gemini
- **Configurable**: Via feature flags

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

- Equipment database as knowledge base
- Booking history for context
- Customer data for personalization

### Vector Database (Optional)

- Equipment embeddings
- Semantic search
- Similarity matching

## AI Features Timeline

### Phase 2 (AI Integration)

- Risk scoring engine
- Equipment recommendations
- Smart bundles
- Demand prediction

### Phase 3 (Advanced AI)

- Predictive maintenance
- Automated workflows
- Advanced analytics
- Multi-language AI support

## AI Security

- **No financial decisions**: AI cannot approve payments
- **Audit trail**: All AI recommendations logged
- **Human review**: High-risk decisions require human review
- **Bias mitigation**: Regular model evaluation

## AI Implementation

### Service Structure

```typescript
// lib/services/ai.service.ts
export class AIService {
  static async assessRisk(booking: Booking): Promise<RiskAssessment> {
    // AI risk assessment
  }

  static async suggestDeposit(booking: Booking): Promise<DepositSuggestion> {
    // AI deposit calculation
  }

  static async recommendAlternatives(unavailableEquipment: Equipment): Promise<Equipment[]> {
    // AI equipment recommendations
  }
}
```

### Event Integration

- `ai.risk_assessed` - Risk assessment complete
- `ai.deposit_suggested` - Deposit suggestion generated
- `ai.alternatives_recommended` - Equipment alternatives suggested
