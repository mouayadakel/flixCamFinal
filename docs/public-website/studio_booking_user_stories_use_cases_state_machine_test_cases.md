## 0) Definitions & Concepts

### Booking Types (Duration Models)

- **Hourly**: e.g., 2h, 3h, 4h
- **Half-day**: e.g., 4h or 5h (config)
- **Full-day**: e.g., 8h or 10h (config)

### Buffers

- **Auto Buffer** between bookings (e.g., 30 min cleaning/setup) — configurable

### Add-ons vs Packages vs Presets

- **Add-ons:** single optional extras (technician, extra lights, deep cleaning, props)
- **Studio Package / Preset:** curated bundle of add-ons and/or fixed setup (Podcast, Product, Interview)
- **Cross-sell Equipment:** equipment added from catalog to complement the studio session

### Key Pages (Public)

- **/studios** (studio landing/list)
- **/studio/{slug}** (studio details)
- **/studio/{slug}/book** (booking)
- **/cart** (shared cart)
- **/checkout** (payment)
- **/booking/confirmation/{id}**

# 1) Scenario A — Studio Only (Hourly / Half-Day / Full-Day)

## 🧑‍💻 User Story (US-ST-A01)

**As a** client
**I want** to book a studio for a chosen date/time and duration (hourly/half-day/full-day)
**So that** I can reserve the space without contacting support

### Step-by-Step Journey (Entry → Post-Payment)

1. Client enters **Home** and clicks **Studios** (or direct `/studios`)
2. Client opens a studio **/studio/{slug}**
3. Client clicks **Check availability / Book now** → `/studio/{slug}/book`
4. Client selects:
   - date
   - start time
   - duration (hourly / half-day / full-day)
5. System shows **real-time price breakdown**
6. System validates:
   - slot availability
   - buffer rules
   - opening hours
7. Client adds booking to cart
8. Client proceeds to checkout
9. Client pays
10. System confirms booking and sends confirmation message + summary

---

## ⚙️ Use Case (UC-ST-A01)

**Actor:** Client

### Preconditions

- Studio is published and active
- Business hours configured
- Buffer rules configured
- Payment gateway active

### Main Success Flow

1. Client selects date/time + duration
2. System checks conflicts (including buffer)
3. System computes price (hourly/half/full)
4. Client confirms and pays
5. Booking becomes **Confirmed**

### Alternate / Error Flows

- **A1:** Selected time overlaps with existing booking → show conflict + suggest nearest available times
- **A2:** Selected start time violates buffer window → system blocks and suggests valid times
- **A3:** Selected time outside opening hours → system blocks and shows available hours
- **A4:** Client changes duration after selecting time → system re-validates availability + recomputes price
- **A5:** Payment fails → keep booking as _Payment Failed_ with retry link

### Postconditions

- Booking status = Confirmed
- Calendar slot locked
- Confirmation sent (WhatsApp/SMS/Email based on toggles)

# 2) Scenario B — Studio + Studio Package (Podcast / Product / Flash Setup …)

## 🧑‍💻 User Story (US-ST-B01)

**As a** client
**I want** to book the studio using a ready package (e.g., Podcast / Product / Flash)
**So that** the session is prepared and priced clearly with one click

### Step-by-Step Journey

1. Client opens `/studio/{slug}/book`
2. Client selects a **package card**:
   - Podcast Session
   - Product Shoot Setup
   - Flash Portrait Setup
3. Package auto-fills:
   - default duration
   - included add-ons (lights, mics, backdrops)
4. Client selects date/time
5. System validates slot + buffer
6. Client can edit add-ons (optional)
7. Checkout → pay → confirmation

---

## ⚙️ Use Case (UC-ST-B01)

**Actor:** Client

### Preconditions

- Packages are configured and enabled
- Package includes defined add-ons and pricing rules

### Main Success Flow

1. Client chooses package
2. System sets defaults (duration + included add-ons)
3. Client selects time slot
4. System validates and computes total
5. Payment and confirmation

### Alternate / Error Flows

- **B1:** Package requires minimum duration → system enforces
- **B2:** Add-on not available (e.g., technician busy) → show “unavailable” and offer alternatives
- **B3:** Client removes included add-on → allow or disallow based on package rules

### Postconditions

- Booking confirmed
- Package + add-ons recorded

# 3) Scenario C — Studio + Equipment added from Equipment Catalog

## 🧑‍💻 User Story (US-ST-C01)

**As a** client
**I want** to add equipment from the catalog to my studio booking
**So that** I can shoot with the gear I need in the same reservation

### Step-by-Step Journey

1. Client books studio (Scenario A or B)
2. System offers **Add equipment** link
3. Client opens equipment selection (modal or `/equipment?mode=studio&dates=...`)
4. Client filters by date (same as studio slot)
5. Client adds available equipment
6. Cart shows studio + equipment together
7. Checkout → payment → confirmation includes both

---

## ⚙️ Use Case (UC-ST-C01)

**Actor:** Client

### Preconditions

- Equipment rental is enabled
- Equipment availability check supports same date/time window

### Main Success Flow

1. Client selects studio slot
2. Client adds equipment
3. System validates equipment availability for that time window
4. Combined checkout
5. Payment
6. Confirmed

### Alternate / Error Flows

- **C1:** Equipment unavailable for chosen slot → show alternatives
- **C2:** Client changes studio time after adding equipment → system re-checks equipment availability
- **C3:** Partial availability → allow removing unavailable items or changing time

### Postconditions

- Studio slot locked
- Equipment locked

# 4) Scenario D — Studio with Add-ons (No package)

## 🧑‍💻 User Story (US-ST-D01)

**As a** client
**I want** to book a studio and optionally add add-ons (technician, extra lighting, deep cleaning)
**So that** I can tailor the session to my needs

## ⚙️ Use Case (UC-ST-D01)

- Same as Scenario A but with add-on selection before cart

### Alternate / Error Flows

- **D1:** Add-on requires staff availability → if staff not available, block selection and show next available

# 5) Studio Booking State Machine (Lifecycle)

## 🧠 State Machine (High-Level)

**Core states:**

- **Draft**: booking being built (dates/time not finalized)
- **Validated**: slot valid and price computed
- **Payment Pending**: user sent to payment gateway
- **Confirmed**: payment success, booking locked
- **Active**: session started (optional, operational)
- **Completed**: session ended
- **Cancelled**: cancelled by user/admin according to policy
- **Payment Failed**: payment attempt failed
- **Expired**: payment not completed within TTL

### Transitions

- Draft → Validated (when slot passes validation)
- Validated → Payment Pending (when user clicks Pay)
- Payment Pending → Confirmed (payment success callback)
- Payment Pending → Payment Failed (payment failure callback)
- Payment Pending → Expired (TTL)
- Confirmed → Cancelled (policy allows)
- Confirmed → Active (start time)
- Active → Completed (end time)

  Payment Pending → Expired (TTL)
  Confirmed → Cancelled (policy)

- Maintain a payment session TTL to prevent dead locks
- For add-ons requiring staff, model availability similarly to studio slots
- For studio+equipment, align equipment availability to the exact studio window
