- Availability always revalidated before payment

### Selling Layers

- **Equipment only** (single or multiple items)
- **Recommended equipment** (contextual cross-sell)
- **Bundles** (discounted grouped items)
- **Packages / Offers** (predefined deals)

### Key Public Pages

- **/equipment** (catalog)
- **/equipment/{slug}** (details)
- **/cart**
- **/checkout**
- **/booking/confirmation/{id}**
