## What Can Be Tested Without API Keys

### ✅ Already Verified:

- TypeScript compilation (0 errors)
- File structure and organization
- Import/export correctness
- Code syntax and structure

### ⚠️ Requires Dev Server:

- Page rendering (needs Next.js dev server)
- Component mounting
- Route navigation
- API route responses (with mock data)

### ❌ Requires Full Setup:

- Database queries (needs database connection)
- Authentication flow (needs auth setup)
- Real data display (needs seeded database)
- Contract signing (needs database write access)

## Next Steps for Testing

### Option 1: Manual Testing (Recommended)

1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Log in as a client user
3. Navigate to `/portal/dashboard`
4. Test each page and feature manually
5. Verify data displays correctly
6. Test contract signing flow
7. Verify signature saves correctly

### Option 2: Automated Testing (Future)

1. Create E2E tests with Playwright/Cypress
2. Create integration tests for API routes
3. Create unit tests for components
4. Set up test database
5. Create test fixtures

### Option 3: Quick Verification

1. Check TypeScript compilation: ✅ Done
2. Check file structure: ✅ Done
3. Start dev server and check for runtime errors
4. Verify pages load without errors
5. Check console for warnings

## Current Status

**Code Implementation**: ✅ **100% Complete**  
**TypeScript Errors**: ✅ **0 Errors**  
**Runtime Testing**: ❌ **Not Done**  
**Manual Testing**: ❌ **Pending**

---

## Recommendation

**Phase 6 code is complete and ready for testing.**

To fully test Phase 6, you should:

1. Start the dev server (`npm run dev`)
2. Log in as a client user
3. Navigate through all portal pages
4. Test the contract signing flow
5. Verify all data displays correctly

The code structure is correct, TypeScript compiles without errors, and all required features are implemented. The remaining testing requires runtime execution and database access.
