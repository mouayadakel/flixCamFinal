## State Machine Implementation

### States (8 total):

1. **DRAFT** (مسودة) - Initial state
2. **RISK_CHECK** (فحص المخاطر) - Automated risk assessment
3. **PAYMENT_PENDING** (انتظار الدفع) - Waiting for deposit
4. **CONFIRMED** (مؤكد) - Payment received
5. **ACTIVE** (نشط) - Equipment checked out
6. **RETURNED** (مرتجع) - Equipment checked in
7. **CLOSED** (مغلق) - Booking completed
8. **CANCELLED** (ملغي) - Booking cancelled

### Transitions Implemented:

- ✅ DRAFT → RISK_CHECK (submit)
- ✅ RISK_CHECK → PAYMENT_PENDING (auto, if risk acceptable)
- ✅ RISK_CHECK → CANCELLED (auto, if high risk)
- ✅ PAYMENT_PENDING → CONFIRMED (payment received)
- ✅ CONFIRMED → ACTIVE (checkout)
- ✅ ACTIVE → RETURNED (checkin)
- ✅ RETURNED → CLOSED (approve / approve_with_charges)
- ✅ DRAFT/PAYMENT_PENDING/CONFIRMED → CANCELLED (cancel, admin only)

## Integration Points

### State Machine Utility

- Used by: Booking detail page (UI visualization)
- Functions: `getAllowedTransitions()`, `isValidTransition()`, `BOOKING_STATES`

### Booking Service

- Used by: API routes
- Methods: `create()`, `getById()`, `list()`, `transitionState()`, `performRiskCheck()`, `cancel()`

### Booking Policy

- Used by: Booking service (authorization checks)
- Methods: `canCreate()`, `canView()`, `canUpdate()`, `canDelete()`, `canTransitionState()`

## Database Integration

All operations use Prisma with:

- ✅ Proper soft delete filtering (`deletedAt: null`)
- ✅ Relations (customer, equipment, payments, contracts)
- ✅ Transaction safety for state transitions
- ✅ Equipment availability updates
- ✅ Audit logging for all state changes
- ✅ Type safety with Prisma types

## Security

- ✅ Authentication required for all endpoints
- ✅ Permission checks via BookingPolicy
- ✅ User ID tracking (createdBy, updatedBy)
- ✅ Audit logging for all actions
- ✅ State transition validation
- ✅ Input validation with Zod

## Next Steps

**Phase 5: Integrations** is ready to begin.

### Required Before Phase 5:

1. Test all booking management features
2. Verify state machine transitions work correctly
3. Test with real database data
4. Verify equipment availability checking
5. Test risk check functionality
6. Verify audit logging works

## Notes

- ⚠️ **State Machine**: Two implementations exist:
  - `lib/booking/state-machine.ts` - UI utility for visualization and allowed transitions
  - `lib/services/booking.service.ts` - Business logic for actual state transitions
  - Both are used together: UI uses utility, API uses service
- The booking service already had comprehensive CRUD operations - we integrated the state machine utility for UI purposes

- All pages are Arabic-first with RTL layout

- Equipment selection in create form uses visual multi-select pattern

- State machine UI component shows progress bar with all 8 states

**Phase 4 Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

Ready to proceed to **Phase 5: Integrations** when testing is complete.
