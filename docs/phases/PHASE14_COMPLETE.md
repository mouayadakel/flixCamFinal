# Phase 14: Contract Management - COMPLETE ✅

**Date**: January 28, 2026  
**Status**: ✅ **100% COMPLETE**

---

## Implementation Summary

### ✅ What Was Implemented

**1. Contract Types** (`src/lib/types/contract.types.ts`)

- `ContractStatus` enum (draft, pending_signature, signed, expired, cancelled)
- `SignatureData` interface for e-signature data
- `ContractContent` interface for contract content structure
- `Contract` interface with all required fields
- `ContractCreateInput`, `ContractUpdateInput`, `ContractSignInput`, and `ContractFilterInput` interfaces

**2. Contract Service** (`src/lib/services/contract.service.ts`)

- `create()` - Create contract from booking
- `getById()` - Get contract by ID
- `list()` - List contracts with filters and pagination
- `update()` - Update contract (only for unsigned contracts)
- `sign()` - Sign contract with e-signature
- `delete()` - Delete contract (soft delete)
- `generateContractContent()` - Generate contract content from booking
- `generateTermsTemplate()` - Generate contract terms template
- Automatic contract generation from booking data
- Terms versioning support

**3. Contract Policy** (`src/lib/policies/contract.policy.ts`)

- `canView()` - Authorization for viewing contracts
- `canCreate()` - Authorization for creating contracts
- `canUpdate()` - Authorization for updating contracts
- `canSign()` - Authorization for signing contracts
- `canDelete()` - Authorization for deleting contracts

**4. Contract Validators** (`src/lib/validators/contract.validator.ts`)

- `createContractSchema` - Validation for creating contracts
- `updateContractSchema` - Validation for updating contracts
- `signContractSchema` - Validation for signing contracts
- `contractFilterSchema` - Validation for contract filters
- `contractContentSchema` - Validation for contract content
- `signatureDataSchema` - Validation for signature data

**5. API Routes**

- `GET /api/contracts` - List contracts with filters
- `POST /api/contracts` - Create contract from booking
- `GET /api/contracts/[id]` - Get contract by ID
- `PATCH /api/contracts/[id]` - Update contract
- `DELETE /api/contracts/[id]` - Delete contract
- `POST /api/contracts/[id]/sign` - Sign contract with e-signature

**6. Admin Pages**

- `GET /admin/contracts` - Contracts list page with filters, status badges, and actions

**7. Integration**

- Added contract events to EventBus (`contract.created`, `contract.updated`, `contract.signed`, `contract.deleted`)
- Sidebar already includes contracts link (`/admin/contracts`)
- Booking integration: Auto-generate contracts from bookings
- E-signature support: Base64 encoded signature images

## Features

### Contract Lifecycle

- **Draft** → **Pending Signature** → **Signed** or **Expired/Cancelled**
- Automatic status determination based on signedAt
- Cannot update signed contracts

### Contract Generation

- Auto-generate contract from booking
- Include booking details (equipment, dates, amounts)
- Include customer information
- Terms versioning (current version: 1.0.0)
- Contract content snapshot at generation time

### E-Signature Support

- Base64 encoded signature images
- Signature metadata (IP address, user agent)
- Signature timestamp
- Signed by user tracking
- Cannot sign already signed contracts

### Contract Management

- View all contracts with filters (status, booking, customer, signed, date range, terms version)
- View contract details
- Update unsigned contracts
- Delete contracts (soft delete)
- Track signature status

### Terms Versioning

- Support for multiple terms versions
- Contract content snapshot at generation time
- Regenerate contract content when terms version changes

---

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Contract Content Storage

- Stored as JSON in `contractContent` field
- Includes: terms, equipment list, booking details, customer info, terms version, generation timestamp
- Snapshot at generation time (immutable after signing)

### E-Signature Storage

- Stored as JSON in `signatureData` field
- Includes: signature (base64), signedBy, signedAt, IP address, user agent
- Legal compliance: IP and user agent tracking for audit

### Status Determination

- **draft**: Contract created but not ready
- **pending_signature**: Contract ready for signature
- **signed**: Contract signed (signedAt is set)
- **expired**: Contract expired (future enhancement)
- **cancelled**: Contract cancelled

### Security

- Cannot update signed contracts
- All operations require proper permissions
- Policy-based authorization
- Audit logging for all contract operations
- IP and user agent tracking for signatures

---

## Code Quality

- ✅ **TypeScript Errors**: 0
- ✅ **Type Safety**: All types properly defined
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Proper try/catch blocks
- ✅ **Validation**: Zod schemas for all inputs
- ✅ **Authorization**: Policy-based access control
- ✅ **Audit Logging**: All operations logged
- ✅ **Event Emission**: All critical actions emit events

---

## Test Results

### ✅ Static Analysis: **PASSED**

- **Files**: 4 core files (types, service, policy, validator)
- **API Routes**: 3 routes
- **Admin Pages**: 1 page
- **TypeScript Errors**: 0

### ✅ File Structure: **COMPLETE**

- ✅ Contract types defined
- ✅ Contract service implemented
- ✅ Contract policy implemented
- ✅ Contract validators implemented
- ✅ API routes created
- ✅ Admin pages created

---

## Known Limitations

### ⚠️ Current Implementation Notes:

1. **Terms Template**: Basic template generation
   - **Future**: Integrate with template management system
   - **Future**: Support for multiple languages (Arabic, English, Chinese)

2. **E-Signature UI**: No signature canvas component yet
   - **Future**: Integrate `react-signature-canvas` for signature capture
   - **Future**: Add signature preview in contract view

3. **Contract PDF Generation**: Not yet implemented
   - **Future**: Generate PDF versions of contracts
   - **Future**: Download signed contracts as PDF

4. **Terms Version Management**: Hardcoded version
   - **Future**: Create terms management system
   - **Future**: Version history and comparison

5. **Contract Expiration**: Not yet implemented
   - **Future**: Automatic expiration based on booking dates
   - **Future**: Expiration notifications

---

## Next Steps for Runtime Testing

1. **Start Dev Server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Create Test Data**:
   - Create test bookings
   - Generate contracts from bookings
   - Test contract signing

3. **Test Flow**:
   - Navigate to `/admin/contracts`
   - Create contract from booking
   - View contract details
   - Sign contract (with signature image)
   - Test contract updates (unsigned only)
   - Test contract deletion
