  - Updated `getById()` - Get payment with booking and customer details
  - Updated `getByBookingId()` - Get payments for a booking with full details
- Existing methods (already implemented):
  - `create()` - Create payment intent
  - `process()` - Process payment (mark as success)
  - `markFailed()` - Mark payment as failed
  - `requestRefund()` - Request refund (creates approval request)
  - `processRefund()` - Process refund after approval
  - `verifyWebhookSignature()` - Verify Tap webhook signature

**3. Payment Policy** (`src/lib/policies/payment.policy.ts`)

- `canView()` - Authorization for viewing payments
- `canCreate()` - Authorization for creating payments
- `canUpdate()` - Authorization for updating payments
- `canRefund()` - Authorization for processing refunds
- `canDelete()` - Authorization for deleting payments

**4. Payment Validators** (`src/lib/validators/payment.validator.ts`)

- `createPaymentSchema` - Validation for creating payments
- `updatePaymentSchema` - Validation for updating payments
- `paymentRefundSchema` - Validation for refund requests
- `paymentFilterSchema` - Validation for payment filters

**5. API Routes**

- `GET /api/payments` - List payments with filters
- `GET /api/payments/[id]` - Get payment by ID
- `PATCH /api/payments/[id]` - Update payment status
- `POST /api/payments/[id]/refund` - Request refund (creates approval request)

**6. Admin Pages**

- `GET /admin/payments` - Payments list page with filters, status badges, and actions

**7. Integration**

- Added payment events to EventBus (`payment.created`, `payment.success`, `payment.failed`, `payment.refunded`)
- Sidebar already includes payments link (`/admin/payments`)
- Refund workflow with approval system (already implemented)
- Links to bookings and customers

- **TypeScript Errors**: 0

### ✅ File Structure: **COMPLETE**

## Next Steps for Runtime Testing

1. **Start Dev Server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Create Test Data**:
   - Create test bookings
   - Create test payments
   - Test refund requests

3. **Test Flow**:
   - Navigate to `/admin/payments`
   - View payment list
   - Filter payments by status
   - View payment details
   - Request refund
   - Test approval workflow
   - Process refund after approval
