## 📝 Migration Notes

### From Temporary Storage to Proper Models

When creating proper database models, migration scripts will be needed:

1. **Quotes Migration**:

   ```sql
   -- Extract from Booking.notes where notes contains '[QUOTE]'
   -- Parse JSON and create Quote records
   ```

2. **Maintenance Migration**:

   ```sql
   -- Extract from Equipment.customFields.maintenance array
   -- Create Maintenance records
   ```

3. **Invoices Migration**:

   ```sql
   -- Extract from Booking.notes where notes contains '[INVOICE]'
   -- Parse JSON and create Invoice records
   ```

4. **Coupons Migration**:

   ```sql
   -- Extract from FeatureFlag where name starts with 'coupon:'
   -- Parse JSON from description and create Coupon records
   ```

5. **Campaigns Migration**:
   ```sql
   -- Extract from FeatureFlag where name starts with 'campaign:'
   -- Parse JSON from description and create Campaign records
   ```

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **Consistent Architecture**: All features follow the same pattern (types → validators → policies → services → API → UI)
2. **Type Safety**: Strong TypeScript usage prevents many errors
3. **Security First**: Permission system and policies ensure security
4. **Event-Driven**: Event system allows for decoupled architecture

### What Could Be Improved

1. **Database Schema**: Should have created all models upfront
2. **Testing**: Should have implemented tests alongside features
3. **Documentation**: Could have more inline documentation
4. **Error Messages**: Could be more user-friendly in some cases
